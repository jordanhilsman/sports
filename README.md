# Task Manager 
In this project, I aim to create an executable that will be able to visualize the CPU, Memory, and
Disk Storage usage on a machine, as well as allow for interaction with the various processes being
ran by a machine.

## Installation Guide
Clone into the repository 
```console
git clone https://github.com/jordanhilsman/task-manager
```
##Running the program:
There are two options to run the program from the command line. Once in the directory of the repository, 
task_manager.sh should be executeable, or you can manually install the required packages.
```console
./task_manager.sh
```

```console
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```
